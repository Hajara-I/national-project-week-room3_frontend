# Bootcamper Workshop Tracker - (frontend)
# Link to backend repo here <https://github.com/Hajara-I/national-project-week-backend>


## About
This group project was created in Week 9 as part of a week-long project week at The School of Code. This application is designed to help bootcampers easily track their progress with the workshops assigned at The School of Code. Due to the fast-paced nature of the program, bootcampers can easily lose track of the workshops assigned during the course causing them to feel lost. The app is designed to be easy and quick to use. The UI is designed to be bright and lively to make using the app a pleasant and fun experience after a long day of coding bootcamp. Input fields are minimised as user research showed that bootcampers find multiple input fields tedious and tiring. The app was a great prep for our final project which will take place over the course of 4 weeks. We received some great feedback from the judges who seemed quite impressed with our team dynamic and final product.
